## Description :
FollowNut' is a follow up application for nutritionists and their patients. 
There are already a few applications of this kind, certainly very complete, yet usually too complex and too expensive; making the user experience rather unpleasant. On the other hand, alternatives solutions consist in a combinations of free softwares, however time consuming due the increase of management required.
FollowNut' stands in the middle, i.e. a user friendly and affordable application. It offers the essential tools a dietetician needs, from appointment scheduling, health data input, to patients follow up; and allows the nutritionist spending more time helping his/her clients.
